Mostly is a matter of taste, you like R or you don't, the same goes for python. \n\nFull disclosure, I am a python fan, so I may be biased ;-)\n\nMore computer science oriented people hate R with all their soul because it has not been really designed as a programming language, its syntax is a little odd and it takes time to get used to it and despite there are a lot of packages they have been designed by different people without really a plan using different interfaces/parameters and sometimes is difficult to do something without having to use many libraries together. \n\nMore data analysis/statistics oriented people love R because they are used to it, it has been there forever and it is similar to other statistical tools or languages like minitab, SAS or SPSS. The python fans would say that R fans do not now any better.\n\nR is ok for most of the tasks for ML, it is older than python and it is very oriented to statistical analysis so it has more specialized libraries for that and if you have to develop a ML proyect in a specialized area more statistics oriented probably you will have R libraries that will solve your problem. Although, once you have your model you will have to resort to other language for deployment.\n\nThe advantage of this hate/love relationship is that both languages are taking the good things of the other, putting some order in the libraries/tools and allowing to use one language from the other so both communities have access to all tools. See for example the collection of R packages in the Tidyverse (https://www.tidyverse.org/).\n\nIn the end, the funny thing is that the core of R and python is the well optimized matrix operations/linear algebra/optimization libraries that were implemented in Fortran/C decades ago.\n\n\n"

Obviously these packages go beyond the methods that we will see during the course, they are at the bleeding edge of neural networks research but they are also focused on industrial applications. Their developement cicle is also very fast with a new version almost every month.\n\nThe basic principle of all these libraries is that all ML algorithms are just functions that can be described by a graph and that can be optimized using clever optimization algorithms (basically advanced gradient descent) using automatic differentiation.\n\nThis makes the implementation of algorithms uniform, you describe the graph and the optimization algorithm takes care or the rest. They are also oriented for real big data (millions of example) with distributed and GPU training \n\nThese libraries were developed initially in academia by the leaders on neural networks/ML research, but now have been taken over literally by the big internet companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft (literally means that most of the big guns in ML research and their teams now work for these companies).\n\nThe main libraries are:\n\n+ Google's Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org) (with Keras if you do not want to get your hands dirty with low level nuisance)\n+ Facebook's Pytorch (https://pytorch.org/)\n+ Amazon/MS/intel/Baidu backed open source MXNet (https://mxnet.apache.org/) (with Gluon for avoiding going low level)\n+ Microsoft's CNTK (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/)\n\nThese libraries are hard stuff and complex to use for beginners so they are the next level if you are really interested on machine learning and AI applications in industry."
